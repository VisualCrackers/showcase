{{< /hint >}}

## What is this showcase?

This website is deployed as a project showcase for the [Visual Computing](https://visualcomputing.github.io/) class at the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/).

## What will you find here?

Here you will encounter multiple projects related to Visual Computing that our team has developed during the semester. On the left side of the screen, you will find a menu with different sections, each one containing several code snippets and examples on the topics covered in the class. Additionally, there's an introduction and conclusion section for each topic, so feel free to explore the content. 

{{< hint warning >}}
We recommend you to check the website through a desktop computer, as some of the content is not optimized for mobile devices, especially the code snippets.
