# **Conclusions & Future work**

The use of image processing technology, such as the p5.js library and OpenCV, can greatly enhance the visual appeal of applications and improve accessibility for people with visual impairments or color blindness. The ability to change the color palette of an image using tools like p5.js can make it easier to apply modifications to images. Additionally, specific color palettes like IBM, Wong, and Tol can help people with visual impairments better understand the images.

It's important to note that the choice of color palette is not a universal solution for visual impairments, as different types of impairments have different limitations. However, recoloring can still be an effective tool for improving accessibility and understanding.

In addition to aiding people with visual disabilities, color tracking technology can be used in applications that require real-time object tracking, such as in augmented reality or robotics. This can help to detect specific colors in an image or video and take appropriate actions based on that information.

Finally, the palette generator tool can be a helpful resource for graphic and product designers, as it can assist in creating visually appealing and harmonious color combinations for their designs.

Overall, the use of image and graphics processing technology has immense potential to improve people's lives in various ways, from enhancing accessibility to improving design and visual presentation.

## Future Work

Firstly, there is a need for further development and refinement of color manipulation tools for people with visual impairments. While existing color palette libraries have been designed specifically for this purpose, there is still room for improvement in terms of their effectiveness and ease of use. Additionally, the development of new tools that can automatically adjust color schemes based on individual user preferences could further improve accessibility.

Secondly, there is a growing need for real-time color tracking and object recognition capabilities in a variety of applications, from augmented reality to robotics. Improvements in these areas could lead to new opportunities for innovation and automation in fields such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare.

Thirdly, there is potential for the development of new image processing techniques that can automatically generate more visually appealing and harmonious color schemes for designers and artists. This could involve the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze existing color schemes and generate new ones, or the development of tools that can automatically adjust color schemes to match a particular design style or aesthetic.

Finally, there is a need for further research into the ethical implications of image and graphics processing technology. As these tools become more advanced and ubiquitous, it is important to consider their potential impact on issues such as privacy, security, and social justice.

In conclusion, while there have been many advancements in image and graphics processing technology, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of improving accessibility, real-time tracking, automated color scheme generation, and ethical considerations. Future developments in these areas could have a significant impact on a variety of industries and individuals, and should be a priority for researchers and developers.
