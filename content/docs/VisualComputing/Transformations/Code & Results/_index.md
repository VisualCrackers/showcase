# **Code & Results**

In this sections, we'll present the main and more interesting results of the different snippets we've done on the topic of Transformations. Each one of these codes is discussed in detail in the corresponding section of the website.

## Snippets

Here we'll present a brief description of each one of the code snippets.

## [2D solar system](./2D-Solar-System)

This example uses the basic transformations methods to create a cool looking 2D solar system.

## [3D solar system](./3D-Solar-System)
This model uses the 3D transformations to create a 3D solar system. It also adds some interactivity to the model, so that we can move around the solar system and see it from different perspectives.

{{< tab "Texture & Lightning" >}}
## [Texture & Lightning](./Texture-Lighting)

This model provides a examples of 3D models using texturized surfaces and different lightings. By using lighting tools, we can add more realism and detail to this model.
