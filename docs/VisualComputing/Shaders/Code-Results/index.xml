Blending colors refers to the process of combining two or more colors to create a new one. The principal theory behind this sketch is manipulate the color components RGB of both colors and determining in which way they will interact.
This idea is applied in areas as Image Editing, Lighting and Shading, Color Interpolation and Color Correction. There are several operations that allow to obtain different results, such as addition, multiplication, substraction, overlay, screen, darken, lighten and so more.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Shaders/Code-Results/Glitch-Board/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Shaders/Code-Results/Glitch-Board/</guid><description>Board with Glitch Effect # This sketch is an easy but interesting application of shaders. It is based on the decomposition of colors, showing the strokes made, but adding a glitch effect that separate the Red, Green and Blue colors that make up the white light.
Glitch art is a digital art form that embraces and celebrates imperfections, errors, and technical malfunctions as a creative aesthetic. It involves intentionally distorting or manipulating technology to produce unexpected visual or auditory effects.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Shaders/Code-Results/Mosaic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Shaders/Code-Results/Mosaic/</guid><description>PhotoMosaic # This program utilizes the power of shaders to create captivating photomosaic effects. By analyzing the luminance of each pixel in an original image, the program intelligently selects smaller images from a palette to replace the pixels, resulting in a visually stunning composition of smaller images that form the larger picture.
Each tile is replaced with a carefully chosen image from a collection of smaller images, creating a mosaic-like representation of the original.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Shaders/Code-Results/Smart-Mosaic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Shaders/Code-Results/Smart-Mosaic/</guid><description> Smart PhotoMosaic #</description></item></channel></rss>
