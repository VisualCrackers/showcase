These illusions are produced by the complex interaction between our visual system and our brain.
The brain receives information through the eyes and process it to create a coherent image of the world around us. However, this process is not always perfect and can be fooled by various visual illusions that make us perceive things differently than they really are.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Visual-Ilusions/Conclusions-Future-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Visual-Ilusions/Conclusions-Future-work/</guid><description>Conclusions &amp;amp; Future work # The use of image processing technology, such as the p5.js library and OpenCV, can greatly enhance the visual appeal of applications and improve accessibility for people with visual impairments or color blindness. The ability to change the color palette of an image using tools like p5.js can make it easier to apply modifications to images. Additionally, specific color palettes like IBM, Wong, and Tol can help people with visual impairments better understand the images.</description></item></channel></rss>
