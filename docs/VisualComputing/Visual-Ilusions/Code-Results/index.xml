The colors are variables that really affect the interaction of consumers with the product, so making a selection of the appropriate palette is a task that must be properly contemplated, and even more so when trying to make the product accessible to everyone.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Visual-Ilusions/Code-Results/ColorTracker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Visual-Ilusions/Code-Results/ColorTracker/</guid><description>Color tracker # The reduced ability to distinguish between certain colors due to a genetic defect such as color blindness, makes color an important variable when making any design; that is why it is important to try to reduce the inconveniences that this can cause. Additionally, this different or null perception of colors is not only a condition like things are seen, but it also affects the ability to get information from the environment.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Visual-Ilusions/Code-Results/ReColoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcrackers.github.io/showcase/docs/VisualComputing/Visual-Ilusions/Code-Results/ReColoring/</guid><description>Re-Coloring # The possibility of changing the colors of a figure is one of the most interesting features of computer graphics, since it allows image transformations to be carried out in a simple and fast way. In this case, the p5.js library has been used to transform the colors of an image based on the change in the palette you are using.
Through the use of different color palettes, effects can be obtained in the image that can be implemented to help people with color blindness.</description></item></channel></rss>
